Using dirbuster, I found a path to login.
I tried admin/admin, but got the error "Invalid Username"
I used OWASP ZAP's fuzzer to attempt to find the username
Once it finished, I searched my results for "Invalid Password" and found one where the username was "lotti"
Next, I set up a hydra brute force scan for lotti.

Buuuuut before that could finish and I could log in to get the flag, my ISP auto-blocked me since they say what looked like a DOS.
Currently in the process to resolve that...
