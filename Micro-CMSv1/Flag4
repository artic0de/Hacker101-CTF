This is the first flag I found. Here is what I did:

1. Make two accounts (test/test & asdf/asdf are the ones I made)
2. Log in to asdf, create a post with "For my own eyes only" checked on asdf, log out
3. Log in to test, create a post, then edit that same post. There will be a url like this: `http://35.227.24.107/9daa3e22fd/index.php?page=edit.php&id=4`
4. Change the last number after `$id=` to different numbers (should be sequentially lower if followed directions exactly) until you get to asdf's private post
5. Uncheck "Yes, this is my own eyes only!" and then slick "Save post"
